# Marketing-Campaign-Performance-Dashboard
This project analyzes marketing campaign performance using Excel to help companies understand which channels, campaigns, and audiences drive the best results. The dashboard provides a clean, interactive view of key KPIs, trends, and audience insights.

# 🚀 Project Overview

I started with a raw marketing dataset containing impressions, clicks, conversions, spend, and audience details from various campaigns. To turn this into meaningful insights, I engineered calculated columns like CTR, CPC, CPA, and Conversion Rate, and used Pivot Tables to uncover performance patterns. The final dashboard helps marketers compare channels, identify high-converting audiences, track monthly trends, and optimize future campaigns.

# 🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard highlights four core KPIs:

1. Total Impressions
2. Total Clicks
3. Click-Through Rate (CTR)
4. Conversion Rate
These KPIs give a clear overview of campaign reach, engagement, and conversion performance.
